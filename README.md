# Teensy4WWVBsdr

I took code from https://github.com/DD4WH/Teensy-DCF77 and reworked it to monitor WWVB and to
use the new Teensy 4.0 and the audio board specific for Teensy 4.


## Hardware:

Teensy 4.0  https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html

Audio board (rev D)  https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3_audio.html

Color touchscreen https://www.pjrc.com/store/display_ili9341_touch.html



## Interconnections:

### pictures
I've added some pictures of my implementation.

For antenna I have the top section of a standard 5 gal bucket which I have sawn off.
I am using some salvaged enameled wire, about 30 turns (?).
Then inside the enclosure the connections from the antenna go to a circuit board
which has some capacitors soldered to it so as to make a resonant antenna.
From there the signal goes into the sound board.
The sound board and Teensy 4.0 are stacked.
From the stack I have connections to the LCD.

I've lined my plastic enclosure with aluminum foil.

The stack of audio/teensy is mounted to the enclosure.
The LCD, capacitor board and foil are just floating around in there...
I still have work to do on my enclosure.
